# MorseCodeChat
Anonymous chat with Morse Code. No usernames or anything else to get in the way- just two annoying sounds that get sent to every person on the server when you click a button. 

In order to both send and receive tone messages, use Chrome. Firefox and other mobile browsers I've tested this with have not been able to send messages, though you will be able to hear any audio traffic.
